Your project will leverage the array of microphones being designed by James, Charles and Yifeng to create a means of designing an new aural experience for Studio-X that responds in real time to the sound being produced by the activity in the space. By introducing speakers into the space, you could pump sound into different zones of the room that would be in response to whatever sound is currently being picked up by the microphone array. Perhaps this could be sound generated programmatically in response to the sound picked up by the microphones, or maybe it's something pre-recorded that is selected to match the activity in the space.

For instance, you may decide that you want to exacerbate frentic activity. So, when the microphone array picks up long bursts of loud staccato sound, you could start to play sounds with an even faster beat in order to push even more crazy energy into the room.

Alternatively, you might be interested in neutralizing by creating a responsive white noise generator. You could split Studio-X up into different zones, analyze the amplitude, duration, pitch, etc., of the sound being collected from each in real time, and then pump out some sound from the speakers in that zone that would be designed to neutralize the sound in the zone being produced by the activity there.

Whatever you produce, it should be a toolkit with a particular function so that the Studio-X users can decide to turn it off and on when they want to use it. Each `program` you propose should have a thesis that answers: why you think this is interesting or useful or valuable, and how you think Studio-X might use it to produce a new type of environment.

When we meet on Monday or Tuesday you should know which content platform you want to use. I suggest you stick with something well known like Tumblr, Twitter and Instagram. Be sure to look on https://npmjs.org/ and search for the platform you choose to make sure there is a Node.js module to connect to it's API.

Each content platform has it's own flavor, a specific content format (square image for Instagram, 140 characters for Twitter...), an audience, a frequency, a tone and even a geographic dominance. You should have a reason for choosing the content platform that keeps this in mind and exploits it. You may also want to choose a platform that is not America specific, such as Weibo, which has Node modules https://npmjs.org/search?q=weibo. 

Your task is to explain to us what kind of content is getting produced, how it's getting produced, where it's going (Tumblr, youtube, Google+, Weibo...), at what frequency, and VERY IMPORTANTLY who might want to consume your content and why.
