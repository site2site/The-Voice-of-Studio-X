The Voice of Studio X
=========

An interactive online platform providing a non-material, imaginative experience of a real time physical context.
We propose to place few microphones in each of the StudioX locations. These microphones will record the interior and exterior 
ambient sound of the place.

We propose two different ways of understanding space through sound.


In the first proposal the microphones will be placed at equal intervals along the length of the space. They will record sounds 
specific for the different sequences of the space.
As one virtually navigates through the space with their mouse, the sound changes as they move from one microphone area to the next with a gradual transition from one to the other
As one hovers over a microphone, information about that particular area will come up.

In the second porposal we place the microphones at different hights in different areas of the room to record natural noises such as walking, stamping, chewing, talking etc.
Information about the event will be displayed in a non-particular way, not directly related to the sound.
By interacting online with the microphones, the sound is projected back in a different location of the space. As such, people from StudioX will feel the presence of the virtual visitors.


This voice-space can somewhat change the way we get information in Internet that is always from page to page (which is 'flat'). The space with different voice information has the possibility to create a sense of 'depth' in the platform. If there can be 3-D grid of microphones set in the space, how it is presented and how people interact with it can be interesting to work on (Maybe can be like a 'Google street' that can zoom in-out, move with the different voice information presented). Or maybe there is a better way to present the 3-D information.
